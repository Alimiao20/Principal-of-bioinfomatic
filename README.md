# Escherichia coli ST117 phylogenetics - How human isolates are related to chicken isolates

**Authors** Yashan Wang, Xinyang Zhang

**Reasearch Aim** To explore the host of an extraintestinal infection Escherichia coli strain ST117 and it's transmittion to human.

**Hypothesis** Escherichia coli ST117 is considered to be poultry origin. Now more human are found to be infected by this strain. Our hypothesis is that human isolates should be very close to chicken isolates, and probably transmitted from chicken.

*Important note:* This is the final project for 6860 bioinformatic.
